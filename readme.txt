This is a fork of the Arduino repository intended for use with the Zigduino Arduino variant (http://www.logos-electro.com/zigduino-r2). Please note that this version is designed to work with Arduino-1.5.

Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple i/o
board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring
language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or
can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP).
The boards can be assembled by hand or purchased preassembled; the open-source
IDE can be downloaded for free.

For more information, see the website at: http://www.logos-electro.com/zigduino-r2
